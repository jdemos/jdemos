# Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I'm an experienced Solutions Engineer currently working at GitHub. Prior to here, I had a brief stint at a FinTech start-up ([Modern Treasury](https://www.moderntreasury.com/)), and before that I spent 8 years at Twitter supporting the enterprise side of their [Developer Platform](https://developer.x.com/en). I'm based in sunny Denver, CO ☀️

- :computer: My go to programming language is Python but I actually started with Ruby years ago.
- ⚡ Fun fact: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is one of my favorite frameworks for building peformant, static websites.
- 🏃 I enjoy trail running and ran my first (_and only_) trail ultramarathon in 2019.
